# Automated API testing


In this project, I used Postman, to thoroughly analyze and evaluate the web responses from a website's APIs. I focused on working with JSON format responses, ensuring that the data received from each API endpoint adhered to the expected structure and functionality.

To ensure the quality and reliability of the website's APIs, I wrote automated test scripts in JavaScript, which were integrated into Postman. These scripts tested various API endpoints, checking for correct status codes, response times, and the accuracy of returned data. Additionally, the tests included validations such as response body structure and the presence of necessary data fields.

By automating the testing process, the project aimed to improve the efficiency of detecting issues within the APIs, allowing for faster bug identification and validation. This approach not only ensured the website's API performance met quality standards but also contributed to its overall stability and scalability.
